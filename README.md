The Sliding Puzzle Game I made during and for the Firefox OS App days in Paris.

It should work fine most mobile and desktop browsers (except Opera for some 
reason I haven't looked into yet), including Firefox, Safari and Chrome on all
platforms.

If for some reason you'd like to test in the Firefox OS simulator, don't use the
stable version, it has some issues  preventing transitions to work properly. 
It was tested and working on the unstable version, as well as real Firefox OS
devices.
